# GROMACS in the Schurch Group
In order to work effeciently a certain organistion is necessary. The following rules needs to be applied:
1. _All data_ concerning the molecular simulation needs to be store in the directory _molecular data_. Those data consist of the different files used to feed GROMACS.
2. For every new molecule tested, a new directory needs to formed in the directory _molecular data_ with the name of the molecule.
3. For every new condition for a already existing molecule a new branch needs to be formed and named accordingly.
4. The results for the simulation need to be in the same directory as the data, in a new directory _results_.
5. In the directory __logic__, important remark and advice for the simulations can be stores, like defaults parameter for a set of parameter used across different molecule. Please write a .md file to explain the choosen parameters and the reasons behind their values (source if possible).
6. Least but no last in the directory __GOAT__ put your best result, images for the pleasure of the group.
