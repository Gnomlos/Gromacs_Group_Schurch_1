### Protein Pipeline
So in order to analyse a lot of protein, we need to have access to them based on their place of origin in the body, then automatically download theit pdb structure, so that it is easier to analyse them. For this the first step is to find a
protein atlas. A website where protein are classified based on their location in the body. For this work we choose the GXe protein atlas.
