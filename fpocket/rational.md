### Rationale: Hydrated Gd³⁺ and the Role of Fpocket in Binding Site Identification

The interaction of gadolinium ions (Gd³⁺) with proteins critically depends on the shape and size of available protein cavities. In water, the gadolinium ion generally coordonate between 7 and 9 water moleucles. In this study, we concentrate ourselfs on the 8th time coordinated complex. In order to select the correct inputs to use *fpocket*, we need to choose two main parameters, the minimum and manximum radius of the **alpha-sphere**. To chose those wisely we need to know what are the dimension of the hydrate. The distance between the gadlinium ion and the first water shell is about 2.4 Å and the distance between the gadolinium ion and the second water shell is about 3.8 Å. Since we want to select possible pocket, we reflected that in order to bond, the gadolinim should only have a **single** water shell and not two. Consequently we parametrized the fpocket with a minimum radius of 4.6 Å and a maximum radius of 7.5 Å.
