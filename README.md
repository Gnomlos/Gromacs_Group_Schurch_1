# Goal of this depository
This depository was done in the contex of trying to use GROMACS for molecular dynamic simulation to pre-test protein-ligan, peptide-ligand interaction before trying them in the lab. This repo, will try to cover the following topics: 
1. How to install gromacs locally to prepare the datas
2. Preparation of the datas in GROMACS
3. Push the data unto a super-computer
4. Analysis of the data
In order to fullfill those objectives, different scripts will be uploaded.
